## Project Setup

On root

```sh
npm install
```

On api folder

```sh
composer install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Front end Development

On project root

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and serve for Back end Development

On folder api

```sh
php -S localhost:8080 -t Public
```

Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in the values for the chosen host address.
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

### Database configuration
A config database file is provided in the api folder, in the Config folder,
you can change the database configuration there, if you want to use another database.

### Postman collection

I've uploaded to the folder postman a exported JSON file with the routes that the api provide, it's simple and
straightforward because of the time, but have all working routes are present.

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

On project root

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Known issues

Don't have a lot of time to work on this project, but I've found some issues that I would like to fix if I had more
time.

- Don't have a route for update user.
- Don't have a route for delete user.
- Don't have a route to make a user admin. Need to do it manually on database.

### Good to know

- There some parts at the front end that are only seen by the admin, like the admin page on profile menu.
- The database already have a user with admin privileges, the email is: admin@gmail.com and the password is:
  administrator.
- I've taken seven days to do this project, but I've worked on it only on weekdays, so I've spent about 40 hours on it.
